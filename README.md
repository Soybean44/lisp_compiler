## Building 
To create the build tools run the following
`cmake -S . -B build`
and to build run the following
`cmake --build build`

## Compiling Lisp
As of right now there is no way to compile files, but when compiling, make sure to keep all files in a folder called `lisp_build`
This folder will not be picked up by version control keeping the repo nice and tidy
